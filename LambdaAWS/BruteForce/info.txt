Zipped the function made in VS code alone and uploaded it. (function takes event and context)
Event is used to pass in the JSON or any uploaded data while context is used for runtime and function info.

Got Numpy from dowload at https://pypi.org/ with python 3.9 and 86_64 linux as version.
Unzipped it into a folder named python. 
Zipped the python folder.
 
Uploaded VSC zip as function. (Nothing outside the def function runs.)
Uploaded python zip as layer.

Added layer to function.
Changed key1 value in the test JSON file to Ji. (Any password you want.)

Ran using JSON file with: {"key1": "jI"}

Log is also automatically created for all runs.
